All aspects detailed in the assignment requirements have been succesfullly 
implemented. I created a notuber folder in my private github repo. Although
simple, I created one CSS file. I used the navigator and xmlhttprequest
objects correctly, along with the data they return. I created pop-up info
windows with appropriate information for myself and other passengers/vehicles,
including distances from my location and the shortest overall distance. I 
also wrote my program such that it handles both cases of being a passenger
or a vehicle. I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment. I spent
approximately 5 hours writing this web application.
